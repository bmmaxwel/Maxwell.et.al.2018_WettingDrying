Raw data and R code used in the analysis and publication of 'Impact of drying-rewetting cycles on nitrate removal rates in woodchip bioreactors'. 

Column_study_EST.Rmd is the Rmarkdown document used to take the raw data collected during the column experiment (NO3 concentrations, DO, temperature, flow, identifiers) and produce the tables and figures shown in the journal article. Various packages may need to be installed in order to run on R Version 1.1.442.

Composite_Samples_Final.csv is the lab results for composite samples of column outflow immediately after rewetting and prior to subsequent wetting. Results for NO3, DOC, TC, TAN, and TKN are given.

RMarkdown_Aug.csv is the .csv file containing all raw data for times, NO3 concentraitons, DO, temperature, flow, identifers, etc over the 287 day experiment.
